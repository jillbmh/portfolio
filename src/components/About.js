            After 17 years working in the social care sector, I have pivoted to the tech world, graduating from the General Assembly Software Engineering Course in October 2023. In my previous role, I tackled complex challenges, honed problem-solving skills, and developed a deep commitment to community well-being. These experiences fuel my passion for using technology to make a positive impact. In the social care sector, I developed a strong passion for accessibility. As a Junior Developer, I'm excited to bring this focus into the tech world by blending my coding skills with my drive to make platforms more user-friendly. I'm excited to grow as a Junior Developer and look forward to contributing to a team that values inclusivity.
